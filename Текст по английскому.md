Hello everyone!  
It’s a great pleasure to see you here today.

My name is Perunov Ilya Romanovich.  
I am a second-year student at Voronezh State University.  
I study Computer Science.  

The topic of my talk is **Education in the UAE**.

**Второй слайд**
I will speak about three things:  
First — schools in the UAE.  
Second — universities.  
Third — English in education.

My talk will take about six minutes.  
After that, you can ask questions.

Let’s begin.

**First: schools in the UAE.**  
School is free for Emirati children.  
Children start school at age 6.  
They study for 12 years.  
Boys and girls often go to different schools.  
They learn Arabic, math, science, and religion.

**Now, let’s talk about universities.**  
The UAE has good universities.  
Some are local, like UAE University.  
Some are from other countries — for example, from the USA or UK.  
Many students from around the world study there.  
Most lessons are in English.

**Finally, English in class.**  
Children start learning English in Grade 1.  
In university, almost all subjects are in English.  
This helps students work in global companies.

**In conclusion**, the UAE cares a lot about education.  
Every child can get a good education.  
The country wants young people to be ready for the future.
